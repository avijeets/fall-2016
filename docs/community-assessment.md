## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
  - Students in RuMAD, the Rutgers Mobile App Development club. 
  - Undergraduate students at Rutgers University studying Computer Science, Information Technology, Entrepreneurship.
  
### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
  - Nearly 30 students actively in RuMAD
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  - 50+
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  - RuMAD has always held workshops for audiences under 50 people.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  - Clubs on data science, mobile app development, gaming, hackathons, and miscellaneous events oriented around learning languages/frameworks.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  - Yes. HackRU and weekly hack nights are frequented by most Computer Science students.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
  - Fairly accessible with the correct advertisement
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  - At time, yes.
- Is there childcare available?
  - Nope.
- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?
  - Nope. 

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  - Yes. I'm not okay with only computer science students attending the talks. I feel most students should have a grasp on how things work, whether it be Internet service or mobile apps, and should be encouraged to come. Most of the clubs and events on campus oriented around computer science are mostly accessible to students in the field. I hope to make these events more accessible.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  - There are events and clubs for most subsections of computer science, whether it be theory or application. 

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
  - Students are motivated to get careers they would enjoy.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
  - Yes.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
  - Yes.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  - Rarely. Some students come in with the mindset of building their wildest dreams. However, most students come in to do something that can help their chances in landing internships or jobs. 
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  - Mobile application development is a great mesh of application and theory of computer science. One day, I hope to 

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
  - One room in the Mathematics building at Rutgers called the CAVE.
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
  - Students pay for parking permits.
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
  - Yes, Rutgers buses run frequently. 
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
  - Yes.
- How much does it cost to use the space?
  - Free. 
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
  - Fairly flexible, all activities need to be ran by the organizer of the CAVE.
- How many people can it fit?
  - Around 50. 
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
  - Yes, seats and outlets are available.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
  - Yes, food and drinks are available by Rutgers funding.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
  - One slack community for an overarching club called the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists, with around 300 users. 
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
  - The Slack community works alongside an updated Facebook fanpage. 

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
  - Fairly welcoming but still clique-y towards Computer Science students.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
  - Most students are mature and accepting to fix any disagreements. 
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
  - All played by ear. 
- How will you personally handle it?
  - I would further a method of documenting bylaws and a constitution
